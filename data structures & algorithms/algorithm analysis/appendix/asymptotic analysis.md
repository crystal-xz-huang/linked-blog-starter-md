Asymptotic analysis (a subset of theoretical analysis) is a method for estimating the efficiency of an algorithm or computer program by identifying its [[data structures & algorithms/appendix/glossary#growth rate|growth rate]] â€” how the algorithm scales as the input size gets bigger.

Asymptotic analysis also gives a way to define the inherent difficulty of a [[data structures & algorithms/appendix/glossary#problem|problem]].

The [iframe](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe) HTML element lets you embed web pages in your notes.

```html
<iframe src="INSERT YOUR URL HERE"></iframe>
```

> [!NOTE]
> Some websites don't allow you to embed them. Instead, they may provide URLs that are meant for embedding them. If the website doesn't support embedding, try searching for the name of the website followed by "embed iframe". For example, "youtube embed iframe".
